- Oracle SQL (HR Schema)

 Write your scripts using WITH Clause. Don’t use subqueries like ….. from (select * from A) …..


1) Return all employees who earns the highest salary in each department. (Hint: use analytic functions)


2) Return number of employees registered for each location.



3) Some departments don’t have any registered employee record. Return 5th letter of those department names. (Don’t try to understand logic here because there is none. It’s just practice.)



4) (Question 3 cont.) Return the string between 1st letter from the end and 3th letter from the end. . (For example => input = ‘Benefits’, output = ‘sti’).



5) (Question 3 cont.) Return reverse of those department names. (For example => input = ‘Benefits’, output = ‘stifeneB’). (HINT: do not use reverse function)
